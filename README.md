# Psst-git-bin

A github-actions-powered binary version of Psst-git so that you don't have to compile it yourself every time (intended for Arch Linux). This binary is set to be built every day at 00:00 UTC time. At that time, it will also update the PKGBUILD if there are any changes.

## Installation
If you would like to install it from the AUR, you can just use the `psst-git-bin` name in your favorite package manager. For example:

###### yay
```bash
yay -S psst-git-bin
```
###### paru
```bash
paru -S psst-git-bin
```

## Credits
All credit goes to `jpochyla/psst` for the awesome app he's created.
